# React Router
> Understanding the basics of react router.

## Project Setup:
> Install react router package by running ```npm install react-router-dom```
>
## Defining Our Routes:
> To define our routes, we import ```createBrowserRouter``` from ```react-router-dom```
> then we call the ```createBrowserRouter``` and pass array of objects in it, in those objects we create a property ```path: '/'``` holding our url path and another property called ```element: <HomePage />``` holding the JSX we want to render.
